abstract="This paper addresses the incorporation of quality measures to video-based person authentication. A theoretical framework to incorporate quality measures in biometric authentication is exposed. Two different quality-based score normalization techniques are derived from this theoretical framework. Furthermore, a quality-based frame selection technique and a new face image quality measure are also presented. The ability of this quality measure and the proposed quality-based score normalization techniques and quality-based frame selection technique to improve verification performance is experimentally evaluated in a video-based face verification experiment on the BANCA Database.",

@article{scface,
  abstract = {In this paper we describe a database of static images of human faces. Images were taken in uncontrolled indoor environment using five video surveillance cameras of various qualities. Database contains 4,160 static images (in visible and infrared spectrum) of 130 subjects. Images from different quality cameras should mimic real-world conditions and enable robust face recognition algorithms testing, emphasizing different law enforcement and surveillance use case scenarios. In addition to database description, this paper also elaborates on possible uses of the database and proposes a testing protocol. A baseline Principal Component Analysis (PCA) face recognition algorithm was tested following the proposed protocol. Other researchers can use these test results as a control algorithm performance score when testing their own algorithms on this dataset. Database is available to research community through the procedure described at                   www.scface.org                                  .},
